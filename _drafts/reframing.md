This post isn't about programming. At least not specifically. Interpret it as you will, but this is derived from a more abstract place. I take that back... don't interpret this as having anything to do with programming. It doesn't.

Due to some recent emotional stress in my life having to do with the passing of a family member, I'm not sure how to feel about a few things bouncing around in my head. One thing that I do know, for it can sometimes take a shit situation like death to bring these realizations to the forefront, is that there is always a way to reframe the way you think about something. Not in the problem-solving sense, but in the "how does this make me feel?" kind of way. In the way that ultimately determines how you let a situation *affect* you.

Wait, stop. If you haven't listened to [David Foster Wallace's brilliant speech]() given at Kenyon College, go do that now. I mean it, and it doesn't matter whether you know his work or not. Because really, what you're reading right now is a less elegant, less poetic and more hastily written version of what David Foster Wallace so perfectly delivers in his speech.

As far back as I can remember I've been unable to cry over the death of a person I loved. And it's not for the lack of the emotional ties, nor an inbalance in my brain, nor anything else related to my health, at least not that I know.

No, I think it's more to do with my discomfort at the way death is "accepted" in our culture. The way its handled and talked about. I always cringe slightly at the traditional funeral mass when the priest leading the ceremony states, in a tone only slightly more engaging than a speaker on C-SPAN, "we are here to celebrate the life of" so-and-so, and so on.
